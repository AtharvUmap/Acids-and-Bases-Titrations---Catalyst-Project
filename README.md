# Acids-and-Bases-Titrations Simulator---Catalyst-Project

Developed and designed in Unity, this mobile simulator leverages 3D game technologies to create a visual interactive tool for students to learn globally.

This free game is published on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DefaultCompany.AcidsandBases&pcampaignid=web_share) with 250+ downloads.


## Content Description: 

Learning can be a tough process, especially when you are unable to visualise the concepts. That is what this game attempts to resolve: it looks to simulate Acid Bases Titrations, while explaining the ideas to allow for a more interactive and understandable learning experience.

In this game, you will go through two titrations (a strong and a weak acid titration), learning what happens each step of the way. You will learn what is happening at each stage, while also understand the math behind it. The process even includes Indicators, so you can visualise the process even better!

It is recommended to have background knowledge on certain Chemistry concepts as Acids and Bases is a later topic. Some topics to know include Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions.

You will learn about...
1. Strong Acid Titrations
a) Also explains the reverse process: adding a strong acid to a strong base
2. Weak Acid Titrations
3. Terms: Titrant, Buffer, Halfway Point, and Equivalence Point
4. Indicators
4. The Mathematical Process behind the reaction
